# i3 Material desktop
This setup came from r/unixporn setup I randomly find. It is simplified and some of the files should be better formatted and organized.

# Contribution
The original setup had a set of scripts for i3bar, but they are not present in author's dotfiles. Feel free to contribute to this setup and enhance it with awesome features. Just open a pull request!
